# Netlify Algolia Index Export [Deprecated]

***This package is being deprecated and closed in favour of using the new official [Algolia Search Netlify plugin](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-netlify). Please upgrade to this new plugin. ***

## Demo

- ~~Demo site: https://netlify-plugins-by-lukeocodes.netlify.app~~

## Usage

To install, add the plugin in your `netlify.toml` or use the [Netlify Plugin Directory](http://app.netlify.com/plugins). There are no required config options, but there are [options available](#Options).

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-algolia-export"
```

There are however *required* environment variables. See the table below. You can read more about setting these in the [Build Config: Environment Variables](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables) Netlify documentation.

| env variable name  | type  | required  | default  | description  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID | String | true | `null` | Your Algolia application ID |
| ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY | String | true | `null` | Your Algolia Admin (or any index-write enabled) API key |
| ALGOLIA_INDEX | String | true | `null` | Your Algolia index name |

These values can be found on the Your API Keys page on your Algolia Dashboard.

## Options

The available options.

| plugins.inputs  | type  | required  | default  | description  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| exclude | Array | false | `[]` | An array of paths to exclude from the build. e.g. `['/admin', '/404.html']` |
| textLength | Number | false | `7000` | The length the body of the page content will be truncated to. This is due to indexing limitations on community versions of Algolia, which we assume is the default. |
| stopwords | Array | false | `[]` | Additional stopwords. @see [stopword](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/stopword) |

## Examples

### Exclude files

Your project probably contains some content files that you don't want your users to search. Pass an array of paths (or regex) to the files you donâ€™t want to be indexed.

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-algolia-export"
    [plugins.inputs]
      exclude = ['''^\/admin.*''', '''^\/search.*''', '/404.html']
```

### Exclude Everything BUT Blog Posts

Advanced Regex Alert! This will exclude all files that DON'T match the regex for URLs like `/blog/(year)/(month)/(day)/(slug)/index.html`.

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-algolia-export"
    [plugins.inputs]
      exclude = ['''^\/(?!blog\/[0-9]{4}\/[0-9]{2}\/[0-9]{2}\/(?!index.html)).*''']
```

## Credit

Based on the [Netlify Search Index Plugin](https://github.com/sw-yx/netlify-plugin-search-index) by [swyx](https://github.com/sw-yx) for fetching and parsing the content into something we can index, then split from the original version of [netlify-plugin-algolia-index](https://github.com/lukeocodes/netlify-plugin-algolia-index).
